Horde3D Port for GameMaker 8

Ported the Horde3D graphics engine to Game Maker 8, There are 3 examples in the archive based on official Horde3D examples. In the future, perhaps I will continue its development and write on its basis a full-fledged engine for GM8, with physics, collision detection, NavMesh, etc.

Horde3D is an open source cross-platform graphics engine. Its purpose and design are similar to OGRE, whose main purpose is to facilitate next-generation video games. The engine is also particularly suitable for simulating a large crowd.
